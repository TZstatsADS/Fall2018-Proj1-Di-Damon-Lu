# Data Story: What Makes People Happy

### Doc Folder

This folder contains the main files of the project. Run `Preprocessing.Rmd` to preprocess the data. A preprocessed copy is already included in `outcome` folder.

To read the data story, you can either open `Data_Story.html` directly or knit the `Data_Story.Rmd` file. Please allow your computer a few seconds to fully load the html file. If some pictures cannot be loaded, please knit the Rmd file directly.
